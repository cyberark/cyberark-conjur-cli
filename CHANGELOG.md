### Changed
- The CLI and SDK now use a system's native credential store to save credentials instead of a netrc file by default. If
  a store is not available, the credentials will be saved to the netrc as a fallback. [cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli#NO]()
- The CLI/SDK package pushed to Pypi has changed from `conjur-client` to `conjur`. [cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli#NO]()
- The .conjurrc parameters have been renamed from `account` to `conjur_account` and from `appliance_url` to `conjur_url`
  . Additionally, the plugins parameter has been removed. This is a breaking change for users who generate their own
  .conjurrc file for use in the SDK and will need to update accordingly.

- Policy functions `apply_policy_file` and `delete_policy_file` have been replaced with `load_policy_file` and

  references in their
  projects [cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli#112](https://github.com/cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli/issues/112)
- CLI command UX has been improved according to UX guidelines
  [cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli#132](https://github.com/cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli/issues/132)
  See [design guidelines](https://ljfz3b.axshare.com/#id=x8ktq8&p=conjur_help__init&g=1)
- Update help screens according to [these guidelines](https://ljfz3b.axshare.com/#id=yokln4&p=conjur_main_help&g=1).
  [cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli#92](https://github.com/cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli/issues/92)
- Directory structure has been refactored.
  See [design document](https://github.com/cyberark/cyberark-conjur-cli/blob/main/design/general_refactorings.md) for
  more details. This is a breaking change. Users who import the SDK in their projects should change their import
  statement from
  `from conjur.client import Client` to `from conjur.api import Client`
